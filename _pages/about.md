I am a researcher and technologist passionate about building intelligent systems that expand the creative and analytical boundaries of music. My work sits at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Music Information Retrieval, with a specialized focus on understanding and generating expressive drum performances.

My research is driven by a personal passion as an active drummer. This hands-on experience informs my pursuit to develop AI that can serve as both an analytical and creative partner. My proposed PhD research outlines a synergistic pipeline for drum understanding and creation, integrating four core tasks:

Drum Source Separation to isolate individual components from a mix.

Drum Transcription to convert audio into symbolic notation.

Drum Performance Analysis to quantify expressive nuances like timing and dynamics.

Drum Pattern Generation to produce human-like, stylistically coherent rhythms.

A key innovation is a generative feedback loop, where the system's own outputs are used to iteratively refine and improve the entire pipeline, creating a dynamic, self-improving AI system for music.

#I am currently seeking a PhD position to advance this research, with the ultimate goal of developing AI-powered tools that empower musicians, enhance music education, and #contribute to the scientific understanding of musical expression.
