excerpt: "Fairy Lied is a gothic metal band in which I serve as the drummer. The band creates original works that fuse dark, introspective lyricism with groove-driven rhythmic energy. Our music explores the emotional interplay between despair and hope, transforming intensity and darkness into channels of creative and expressive inspiration. <br/>"
